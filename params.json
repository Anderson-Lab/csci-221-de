Topics include file input/output, inheritance and polymorphism, exceptions, error handling, and algorithm analysis. Data structures include lists, stacks, and queues. Algorithms include searching and sorting. Prerequisites: CSCI 220 and CSCI 222. Prerequisite or Co-requisite: MATH 207.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n## Required Text\r\nObjects First with Java: A Practical Introduction Using BlueJ (5th Edition), 2012 Retail Price $110.99.\r\n\r\n## Course Details\r\n\r\n### Contact Information\r\n* Professor: Dr. Paul Anderson\r\n* Office: 313 HWEA\r\n* Office Hours: Since this is an online course my office hours will be virtual.

Apply lists implemented as arrays, ArrayLists and other Java Collections classes.\r\n2. Develop algorithms to compute the min/max or sum of lists of numerical values stored in.\r\n* Develop algorithms to search for needed values, and insert records in some order.\r\n* Apply classes in program development including object instantiation, system drivers, constructors, method types (mutators, accessors, predicates, toString, finalizer), static versus nonstatic methods/variables, access qualifiers, garbage collection, use of the this reference.\r\n* Develop well-designed methods.\r\n* Apply class relationships including dependency, aggregation, and inheritance and illustrate such relationships using UML diagrams.\r\n* Apply polymorphism through inheritance and interfaces in problem solving and program development.\r\n* Develop well-designed classes.\r\n* Apply exceptions in program development.\r\n* Recursion: 1. Trace and 2. Develop\r\n\r\n### Grading Policy\r\n\r\n* Midterm - 25%\r\n* Final - 25%\r\n* Project - 25%\r\n* Lessons - 5%\r\n* Programming Assignments and Problem Sets - 20%\r\n\r\nGrading Scale: A: 90-100; B: 80-89; C: 70-79; D: 65-69; F: <65. Plusses and minuses will be used at the discretion of the instructor.\r\n\r\nGrading Guidelines: Submitted work requires Analysis, Evaluation, and Creation of ideas, concepts, and materials into various deliverables (e.g., see revised Bloom's Taxonomy and reference below).\r\n\r\n* The grade of A is for work that involves high-quality achievement in all three Bloom areas.\r\n* The grade of B is for work that involves high-quality achievement in at least two Bloom areas, and medium-level achievement in the other.\r\n* The grade of C is for work that involves high-quality achievement in at least one Bloom area, and medium-level achievement in the others.\r\n* The grade of F is for work that does not meet above criteria.\r\n\r\nReference: Errol Thompson, Andrew Luxton-Reilly, Jacqueline L.

Interesting, but not very helpful. This makes this class ideal for a distance education course. Students are expected to listen to pre-recorded lectures, and then spend the majority of their time completing assignments and projects. The videos will also walk you through a complete software programming project from start to finish.\r\n\r\n### Midterm and Final\r\n\r\nThere will be one midterm covering approximately half of the material. The final exam will be cumulative. Both will be administered within OAKS.\r\n\r\n### Programming Assignments\r\n\r\nProgramming is all about practice. Recently there has been a lot of great online tools built for building up the muscle memory it takes to program. For this course, we will be using Udacity to supplement what we discuss on work on in class. Udacity has 9 problem sets. For each or the 9 problem sets, there will be a dropbox entry in Oaks. You must perform both the draft problem set and the final set to receive full credit. Upload a copy of your progress page (as an image) showing the percentage completed on the section.\r\n\r\nThere will also be a handful of traditionally graded assignments throughout the semester. The grading of these will focus on more subjective skill development, such as style and commenting.\r\n\r\n### Lessons\r\n\r\nUdacity also has questions embedded in the lesson section. Upload a copy of your progress page (as an image) showing the percentage complete on the section.\r\n\r\n### Programming Project\r\n\r\nEach student will choose a semester long project consisting of 7-12 classes. More details of this will be forthcoming as it is assigned.\r\n\r\n### Honor Code\r\n\r\nYou must do your work alone (or with your teammates, for group assignments).\r\nYou must identify your sources of material and inspiration. It is a violation of the honor code to present someone else's work or ideas as your own.\r\nIn any course deliverable, you must always identify the person(s) that helped you (directly or indirectly), if any, and explain their contribution to your work.\r\nAlso see the College of Charleston Student Handbook, especially sections on The Honor Code (p. 11), and Student Code of Conduct (p. 12). There is other useful information there.\r\nClassroom Policies\r\n\r\nYou are expected to participate with questions and invited discussion through the Facebook roup.\r\nIn summary, you should contribute positively to the classroom learning experience, and respect your classmates right to learn (see College of Charleston Student Handbook, section on Classroom Code of Conduct (p. 58)).\r\nLate Policy\r\n\r\nNo late days will be allowed without an excuse. Falling behind on assignments will make it difficult to achieve the learning outcomes of this course.\r\n\r\n### Late Policy\r\n\r\nNo late days will be allowed without a documented excuse.\r\n\r\n## Required Readings\r\n[Software Development Process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_process)\r\n\r\n[Requirement Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_process)\r\n\r\n## Supplemental Videos\r\nChapter 1: VN 1.2 Creating and using objects within BlueJ\r\n\r\nChapter 1: VN 1.3 methods and parameters\r\n\r\nChapter 1: VN 1.4 Solving a challenge exercise\r\n\r\nChapter 2: VN 2.1 The naive ticket machine project\r\n\r\nChapter 2: VN 2.2 introduction to source code - fields and constructors\r\n\r\nChapter 2: VN 2.3 Creating, documenting and testing a new class\r\n\r\nChapter 3: VN 3.1 Fields of class types\r\n\r\nChapter 3: VN 3.2 Constructors and field initialisation\r\n\r\nChapter 3: VN 3.3 Solving the 12-hour clock exercise\r\n\r\nChapter 4: VN 4.1 Introduction to the ArrayList library class\r\n\r\nChapter 4: VN 4.2 Solving the getUnsold exercise\r\n\r\nChapter 4: VN 4.3 Comparing alternatives for iteration in Java\r\n\r\nChapter 5: VN 5.1 Exploring the String API via the tech-support project\r\n\r\nChapter 5: VN 5.2 Making use of class documentation in Java\r\n\r\nChapter 5: VN 5.3 Introduction to static variables\r\n\r\nChapter 6: VN 6.1 Introduction to refactoring, and using StringBuilder\r\n\r\nChapter 6: VN 6.2 Running programs without BlueJ - the main method.\r\n\r\nChapter 6: VN 6.3 Introduction to enums with the zuul project.\r\n\r\nChapter 7: VN 7.1 Introduction to interactive unit testing with BlueJ\r\n\r\nChapter 7: VN 7.2 Automated testing with JUnit within BlueJ\r\n\r\nChapter 8: VN 8.1 Identifying code duplication as possible grounds for inheritance\r\n\r\nChapter 8: VN 8.2 Introducing inheritance into a class\r\n\r\nChapter 8: VN 8.3 Using 'super' to initialise superclass fields\r\n\r\nChapter 9: VN 9.1 Introduction to method overriding and method polymorphism\r\n\r\nChapter 9: VN 9.2 Inherited methods of the Object class\r\n\r\nChapter 9: VN 9.3 The power and risks of inheritance\r\n\r\nChapter 10: VN 10.1 a predator-prey simulation\r\n\r\nChapter 10: VN 10.2 Advanced features of method overriding - abstract methods\r\n\r\nChapter 10: VN 10.3 Exercise solution - the TextView class\r\n\r\nChapter 11: VN 11.1 Inner classes and event handlers\r\n\r\nChapter 11: VN 11.2 Features of four javax.swing layout managers\r\n\r\nChapter 11: VN 11.3 Exercise solution - the abstract Filter class\r\n\r\nChapter 12: VN 12.1 parameter checking and failure detection\r\n\r\nChapter 12: VN 12.2 Writing to a text file in Java\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
