Topics include file input/output, inheritance and polymorphism, exceptions, error handling, and algorithm analysis. Data structures include lists, stacks, and queues. Algorithms include searching and sorting. Prerequisites: CSCI 220 and CSCI 222. Prerequisite or Co-requisite: MATH 207.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n## Required Text\r\nObjects First with Java: A Practical Introduction Using BlueJ (5th Edition), 2012 Retail Price $110.99.\r\n\r\n## Course Details\r\n\r\n### Contact Information\r\n* Professor: Dr. Paul Anderson\r\n* Office: 313 HWEA\r\n* Office Hours: My door is always open.

Apply lists implemented as arrays, ArrayLists and other Java Collections classes.\r\n2. Develop algorithms to compute the min/max or sum of lists of numerical values stored in.\r\n* Develop algorithms to search for needed values, and insert records in some order.\r\n* Apply classes in program development including object instantiation, system drivers, constructors, method types (mutators, accessors, predicates, toString, finalizer), static versus nonstatic methods/variables, access qualifiers, garbage collection, use of the this reference.\r\n* Develop well-designed methods.\r\n* Apply class relationships including dependency, aggregation, and inheritance and illustrate such relationships using UML diagrams.\r\n* Apply polymorphism through inheritance and interfaces in problem solving and program development.\r\n* Develop well-designed classes.\r\n* Apply exceptions in program development.\r\n* Recursion: 1. Trace and 2. Develop\r\n\r\n### Grading Policy\r\n\r\n* Midterm - 25%\r\n* Final - 25%\r\n* Project - 25%\r\n* Lessons - 5%\r\n* Programming Assignments and Problem Sets - 20%\r\n\r\nGrading Scale: A: 90-100; B: 80-89; C: 70-79; D: 65-69; F: <65. Plusses and minuses will be used at the discretion of the instructor.\r\n\r\nGrading Guidelines: Submitted work requires Analysis, Evaluation, and Creation of ideas, concepts, and materials into various deliverables (e.g., see revised Bloom's Taxonomy and reference below).\r\n\r\n* The grade of A is for work that involves high-quality achievement in all three Bloom areas.\r\n* The grade of B is for work that involves high-quality achievement in at least two Bloom areas, and medium-level achievement in the other.\r\n* The grade of C is for work that involves high-quality achievement in at least one Bloom area, and medium-level achievement in the others.\r\n* The grade of F is for work that does not meet above criteria.\r\n\r\nReference: Errol Thompson, Andrew Luxton-Reilly, Jacqueline L.

Interesting, but not very helpful. This class has been designed with this in mind. We will be using a flipped classroom, where students are expected to listen to pre-recorded lectures outside of class. These are tightly integrated with the smaller programming assignments. We will discuss the problems themselves in class when appropriate. More importantly, most of our class time will be spent developing a \"large\" software project from scratch. The software we develop as a class is to serve as a template for your own large software project.\r\n\r\n### Midterm and Final\r\n\r\nThere will be one midterm covering approximately half of the material. The final exam will be cumulative. The final exam will be administered on the last day of class.\r\n\r\n### Programming Assignments\r\n\r\nProgramming is all about practice. Recently there has been a lot of great online tools built for building up the muscle memory it takes to program. For this course, we will be using Udacity to supplement what we discuss on work on in class. Udacity has 9 problem sets. For each or the 9 problem sets, there will be a dropbox entry in Oaks. You must perform both the draft problem set and the final set to receive full credit. Upload a copy of your progress page (as an image) showing the percentage completed on the section.\r\n\r\nThere will also be a handful of traditionally graded assignments throughout the semester. The grading of these will focus on more subjective skill development, such as style and commenting.\r\n\r\n### Lessons\r\n\r\nUdacity also has questions embedded in the lesson section. Upload a copy of your progress page (as an image) showing the percentage complete on the section.\r\n\r\n### Programming Project\r\n\r\nEach student will choose a semester long project consisting of 7-12 classes. More details of this will be forthcoming as it is assigned.\r\n\r\n### Honor Code\r\n\r\nYou must do your work alone (or with your teammates, for group assignments).\r\nYou must identify your sources of material and inspiration. It is a violation of the honor code to present someone else's work or ideas as your own.\r\nIn any course deliverable, you must always identify the person(s) that helped you (directly or indirectly), if any, and explain their contribution to your work.\r\nAlso see the College of Charleston Student Handbook, especially sections on The Honor Code (p. 11), and Student Code of Conduct (p. 12). There is other useful information there.\r\nClassroom Policies\r\n\r\nYou are expected to take good notes during class.\r\nYou are expected to participate in class with questions and invited discussion.\r\nYou are expected to attend all classes. The grade 'WA' will be given for excessive (>= 3) absences. If you miss class, you must get an absence memo from the Associate Dean of Students Office; also, you are responsible for announcements made in class, assignment due dates, etc.\r\nYou should turn off all electronic devices (e.g., cell phones, pagers, etc.).\r\nIn summary, you should contribute positively to the classroom learning experience, and respect your classmates right to learn (see College of Charleston Student Handbook, section on Classroom Code of Conduct (p. 58)).\r\nLate Policy\r\n\r\nNo late days will be allowed without an excuse. Falling behind on assignments will make it difficult to achieve the learning outcomes of this course.\r\n\r\n### Classroom Policies\r\n* You are expected to take good notes during class.\r\n* You are expected to participate in class with questions and invited discussion.\r\n* You are expected to attend all classes.
